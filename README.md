# Hyacinth

A build system that makes compiling Orchid projects a lot easier.

## Usage

Download the latest release and run the `Hyacinth.bat` file! Your application's main file will be in `Project/main.oc`.

### Warning: Compiling a project with Hyacinth for the first time will take approximately 2 minutes. After that, the compilation speed will be vastly faster.

## TODO

* Linux support
