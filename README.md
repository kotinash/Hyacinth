# Hyacinth

A build system that makes compiling Orchid projects a lot easier.

## Usage

Simply download the latest release and run the `Hyacinth.bat` file! Your application's main file will be located in `Project/main.oc`.

### Warning: The first time you compile a project with Hyacinth will take approximately 2 minutes. After that, the compilation speed will vastly faster.

## TODO

* Linux support
